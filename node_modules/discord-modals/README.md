> **A package that allows your discord.js v13 and v14 bot to create, and interact with Modals, a new Discord feature.**

# 🔎 Installation

```sh
npm install discord-modals
yarn add discord-modals
```

# 🔮 What is this package for?

Recently, Discord API officialy announced **[Modal Interactions](https://discord.com/developers/docs/change-log#interaction-modals-and-application-command-attachment-option-type)**.

**What is that?** Modal is a popup of Text Input Components [[Example]](https://discord.com/assets/2087c4210e4723cc26ac1b265940c499.png). It's so cool and useful for many commands that needs arguments. Discord-Modals can be a solution if you want to test or use Modals right now. **Supports discord.js v13 and v14. Try it!**

# ✨ Setup

The most recommended is to put this on your main file.

```js
const { Client } = require('discord.js'); // Get the Client class
const client = new Client(); // Create a Discord Client, with intents and what you need
const discordModals = require('discord-modals'); // Define the discord-modals package!
discordModals(client); // discord-modals needs your client in order to interact with modals

client.login('token'); // Login with your bot token
```

> **Important:** Don't forget to put `discordModals(client)`, will be essential to receive the Modal Submit Interaction.

# ❓ How can i use it?

> First of all, we need to understand that Modals and Text Input Components are completely different. Modals is a popup that shows the text input components and text input are the components of modals. To understand better, you can explore the Discord API Documentation [here](https://discord.com/developers/docs/interactions/message-components#text-inputs).

**Modals have:**

- A Title
- A Custom Id
- Components (Action Rows with Text Inputs)

**Text Inputs have:**

- A Custom Id
- A Style (Short or Paragraph)
- A Label
- A minimum length
- A maximum length
- A value (A prefilled value if there is not text)
- And...a placeholder

If you have understood this, you can continue on "Examples" section.

> **Important:** Modals also support select menus. So, you need to know the select menu structure.

# 📜 Examples

If you are ready, take this examples.

- First, we are going to create a Modal.

```js
const { Modal } = require('discord-modals'); // Modal class

const modal = new Modal() // We create a Modal
	.setCustomId('modal-customid')
	.setTitle('Modal')
	.addComponents();
```

> **This is a basic structure of a Modal, but something is missing. Yeah! Components.**

- We are going to create and add a Text Input Component and a Select Menu to the Modal.

```js
const { Modal, TextInputComponent, SelectMenuComponent } = require('discord-modals'); // Import all

const modal = new Modal() // We create a Modal
	.setCustomId('modal-customid')
	.setTitle('Modal')
	.addComponents(
		new TextInputComponent() // We create a Text Input Component
			.setCustomId('name')
			.setLabel('Name')
			.setStyle('SHORT') //IMPORTANT: Text Input Component Style can be 'SHORT' or 'LONG'
			.setPlaceholder('Write your name here')
			.setRequired(true), // If it's required or not

		new SelectMenuComponent() // We create a Select Menu Component
			.setCustomId('theme')
			.setPlaceholder('What theme of Discord do you like?')
			.addOptions(
				{
					label: 'Dark',
					description: 'The default theme of Discord.',
					value: 'dark',
					emoji: '⚫',
				},
				{
					label: 'Light',
					description: 'Some people hate it, some people like it.',
					value: 'light',
					emoji: '⚪',
				},
			),
	);
```

> **Yay! We have the full Modal, but... How can i send/show a Modal?**

- We are going to use the `showModal()` method to send the modal in an interaction.

```js
const { Modal, TextInputComponent, SelectMenuComponent, showModal } = require('discord-modals'); // Import all

const modal = new Modal() // We create a Modal
	.setCustomId('modal-customid')
	.setTitle('Modal')
	.addComponents(
		new TextInputComponent() // We create a Text Input Component
			.setCustomId('name')
			.setLabel('Name')
			.setStyle('SHORT') //IMPORTANT: Text Input Component Style can be 'SHORT' or 'LONG'
			.setPlaceholder('Write your name here')
			.setRequired(true), // If it's required or not

		new SelectMenuComponent() // We create a Select Menu Component
			.setCustomId('theme')
			.setPlaceholder('What theme of Discord do you like?')
			.addOptions(
				{
					label: 'Dark',
					description: 'The default theme of Discord.',
					value: 'dark',
					emoji: '⚫',
				},
				{
					label: 'Light',
					description: 'Some people hate it, some people like it.',
					value: 'light',
					emoji: '⚪',
				},
			),
	);

client.on('interactionCreate', (interaction) => {
	// Let's say the interaction will be a Slash Command called 'ping'.
	if (interaction.commandName === 'ping') {
		showModal(modal, {
			client: client, // Client to show the Modal through the Discord API.
			interaction: interaction, // Show the modal with interaction data.
		});
	}
});
```

> **Congrats! You show the Modal to the Interaction User. Now, how can i receive the Modal Interaction?**

## 📢 Events: Receiving Modal Submit Interaction and extracting data

- discord-modals integrates to your Client a new event called `modalSubmit`. We are going to use it.
- To have access to the responses, just use the `.getTextInputValue()` method with the Custom Id of the Text Input Component, or if you use Select Menus, the same way, use the `.getSelectMenuValues()` method with the Custom Id of the Select Menu Component.

> **Recommendation:** Put your `modalSubmit` event on your main file or in an Event Handler.

```js
client.on('modalSubmit', async (modal) => {
	if (modal.customId === 'modal-customid') {
		const nameResponse = modal.getTextInputValue('name');
		const themeResponse = modal.getSelectMenuValues('theme');
		modal.reply(
			`Thank you for answering the form! Powered by discord-modals.\nSo, you are **${nameResponse}** and you like the **${themeResponse}** theme. Awesome!`,
		);
	}
});
```

> **And you made it! I hope this examples help you :)**

# ❓ FAQ

Can I show a modal, replying to a modal?

- No, Discord API don't support that, but there are plans to add that.

Can I add buttons/select menus to modals?

- Yes, but only select menus are supported at this moment. Discord API have plans to add other type of components. Be patient :)

Can I show a modal in a message?

- No, modals are **only for interactions** (Select Menus, Slash Commands, Buttons and Context Menu Commands). They are a response for interactions.

Can I add more than 5 Components in a modal?

- No, a modal supports **5 Action Rows (containing 1 Text Input Component or Select Menu per row)**. There is no plans in Discord API to increase the amount of rows per modal.

DiscordAPIError: Interaction has already been acknowledged.

- The `showModal()` method is a response of an interaction. also `reply()` or `deferReply()` are responses of an interaction.
  If you give a response, you can't give a response again. So you need to remove `reply()` or `editReply()` on your code.

- If that doesn't work, probably you have the `modalSubmit` event on the same file of your command, please just add it to a event handler or just separate it.

The Select Menu in Modal is not being displayed in mobile/phone.

- Discord is still developing it, so the select menu is not being displayed in this type of clients. For now, only works in desktop/web client. Use it at your own risk.
